Installation of NMGC
************

How to obtain NMGC
=================

NMGC can be obtained by cloning its repository. This is also the best way to keep up-to-date.
From a terminal, go to a directory where you want to install the code, and type: 

$    git clone https://github.com/sachagavino/nmgc-2.0.git

This will create a folder ``nmgc-2.0/`` in your current repository, which you can access:

$    cd nmgc-2.0/

To make sure you use the latest version, you can type: 

$    git pull
