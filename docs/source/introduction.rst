What is NMGC?
=================
The Nautilus Multi-Grain Code (NMGC) is a gas-grain code for astrochemistry derived from the code Nautilus.
The software is mainly written to compute the chemical evolution of a physical model, given a set of initial chemical abundances. It is particularly 
suited to calculate the chemical abundances in molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.

The particularity of NMGC, as opposed to Nautilus, is its abilitity to consistently use multiple grain populations, each of which with their own density
and temperature. This is a powerful tool to investigate the various effects of dust grain size and temperature on the chemical evolution of
 an astrophysical model.
