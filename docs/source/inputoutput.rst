.. _chap-input-files:

The input and output files of NMGC
***************************************

The input files are the same as for the official version of Nautilus, except for a few differences. Whenever differences exist between the two version, they are mentioned and described below in each section.   

NMGC at minimum six inputs to be able to run. They are described in the following sections whose names are followed by ``(required)``. There are three additional optional input files
that can be added. Wether or not you use these files will depend on your needs, which will be discussed in the following sections whose names are followed by ``(optional)``.
