How to use the code
************


Quickstart
=================

We saw that typing ``nmgc`` in your terminal displays the software banner, with a bunch of suggested actions. These actions are the core of Nautilus and are necessary to use it. 
A detailed description of these options is provided below.


The first thing you want to do is to go to a working directory in which you stored your NMGC input files. 
These files are described in Section :ref:`_chap-input-files`. If you don't know what input files to use for your simulations, you might want to read that section now so you have an idea of how NMGC works.

Once in your working directory, you want to type ``nmgc``, followed by one of the four actions:

* run
* outputs
* rates
* major_reactions

For instance, if you type::

    nmgc run

This will execute the main chemical scheme using your input files.
